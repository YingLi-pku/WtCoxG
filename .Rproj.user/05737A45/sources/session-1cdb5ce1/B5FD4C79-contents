# WtCoxG
WtCoxG is an accurate, powerful, and computationally efficient Cox-based approach to perform genome-wide time-to-event data analyses in study cohorts with case ascertainment. The method accounts for case ascertainment by fitting a weighted null Cox PH model, and allows for an effective integration of external MAFs while adjusting for batch effects.
